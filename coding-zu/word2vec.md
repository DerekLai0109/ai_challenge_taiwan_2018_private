#### Review of Le & Mikolov \(2014\) and introduction into Word2Vec

### Word2Vec Introduction

The "learning continuous word embeddings" method and tool has developed by Mikolov et al \(2013\). The model forms the basis for the study of Le & Mikolov \(2014\). To have a more complete understanding of the model, look at this paper [Xin Rong \(2014\)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738).

Word2Vec attempts to associate words with points in space. The spatial distance between words describes the relation \(similarity\).
