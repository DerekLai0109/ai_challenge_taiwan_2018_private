# Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing \(NLP\) are computational techniques for the automatic analysis and representation of human language.  
 NLP enables computers to perform natural language related tasks, ranging from parsing and part-of-speech \(POS\) tagging, to machine translation and dialog systems.

Machine learning approaches targeting NLP problems have been based on shallow models \(e.g., SVM and logistic regression\) trained on high dimensional and sparse features for decades.  
 Neural networks based on dense vector representations have been producing superior results on various NLP tasks in the last few years.  
This trend is sparked by the success of word embeddings \[1\] and deep learning methods \[2\].  
Deep learning enables multi-level automatic feature representation learning.  
Traditional machine learning based NLP systems relies on hand-craft features which are time-consuming and incomplete.

Deep learning methods employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchical representations of data, and have produced state-of-the-art results in many domains \[0\].  
The deep learning framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in NLP tasks such as named-entity recognition \(NER\), semantic role labeling \(SRL\), and POS tagging \cite{R.Collobert\_2011}.
