Train Machine Learning Models on Google's GPUs for Free - Forever

Training model is the most time consuming and expensive part of machine learning. Training model on a GPU can speed up close to 40x, taking 2 days and turning model into a few hours.

Colab is aimed at being an education and research tool for collaborating on machine learning projects. Colab is completely free forever.

Using Colab doesn't need to setup, only need to log in google account.

Colab provide k80 GPU for unlimited access of 12 hours, and unlimited times, only get disconnected after 12 hours.

To use Colab, first step is to prepare a notebook \(.ipynb\) file, the following is [an example](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mmchiou/ai_challenge_taiwan_2018-private/edit#/edit/master/colab/Tensorflow for Poets.ipynb?_k=w02ioi).![](/assets/notebook_file.png)Fig.1 An example of a notebook \(.ipynb\) file

Go to [Google Colab](http://g.co/colab), sign into google account.

Choose `File` &gt; `Upload notebook...` :
